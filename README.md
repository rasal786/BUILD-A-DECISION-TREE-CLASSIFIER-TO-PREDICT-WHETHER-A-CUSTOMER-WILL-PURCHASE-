# BUILD-A-DECISION-TREE-CLASSIFIER-TO-PREDICT-WHETHER-A-CUSTOMER-WILL-PURCHASE-
# 🧠 Customer Purchase Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involves building a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a customer will **purchase a product or service** based on their **demographic and behavioral data**.

The model can help businesses identify potential customers and optimize their marketing strategies by understanding which factors influence purchasing behavior.

---

## ✅ Task Overview

- Import and explore customer dataset  
- Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, encoding, normalization)  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand trends and distributions  
- Train a **Decision Tree Classifier** using Scikit-learn  
- Visualize the decision tree for interpretability  
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Analyze **feature importance** to extract insights about customer behavior

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – Numerical computing  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning algorithms and evaluation  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive development
